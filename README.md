### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm software developer and programmer for fun!
I work making programs that solve problems in my life as a programmer and also creating applications that I come up with from time to time.



ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
- GeoEvents: GeoEvents is an events platform, where you can create, edit, search for various events around the world or in your country or community.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
- C#
- ASP.NET
- Flask
- PHP
- NodeJs
- C++
- Unity
- Blender


âš¡ Fun fact:
- My username comes from the phrase "hello world" and followed by the number 534, a curious number that I found on wikipedia
