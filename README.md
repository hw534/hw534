Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm software developer and programmer for fun! I work making programs that solve problems in my life as a programmer and also creating applications that I come up with from time to time.


ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on:
GeoEvents: GeoEvents is an events platform, where you can create, edit, search for various events around the world or in your country or community.

ðŸŒ± I would like to dominate:
C#
ASP.NET
Flask
PHP
NodeJs
C++
Unity
Blender
Laravel
Express
React.js & React Native
âš¡ Fun fact:

My old username "hw534" comes from the union of the initials of the famous phrase "Hello World" and the number 534, a curious number I found on Wikipedia, a number that has stayed with me until now.
